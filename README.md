# retime

Sync untimed transcripts with Youtube auto-generated captions.

The goal of this project is not to get a perfect timing immediately, but rather to get a better starting off point for faster manual refining later.

## Installation

Depends `nltk` to parse words.

## Usage

    usage: retime.py [-h] [--max-shift [MAX_SHIFT]] [--fill-space] [--nltk-parse] transcript subtitle output

    Sync transcript with Youtube autogenerated subtitles.

    positional arguments:
      transcript            Input transcript file
      subtitle              Input subtitle.json file
      output                Output file

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --max-shift [MAX_SHIFT]
                            Maximum percentage to move a sentence in the subtitles
      --fill-space          Extend captions to fill all empty time
      --nltk-parse          Split transcript file by sentences instead of by newlines

The transcript file is just any plain text file. Each caption should be separated by a newline. Alternatively, you can use the `--nltk-parse` option to automatically break up text by sentences.

To get a JSON subtitle file from youtube, you can list all subtitle formats with a tool like youtube-dl: `youtube-dl --list-subs VIDEO`, and choose `json3`.
